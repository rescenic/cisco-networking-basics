6.0.1 Webster - Why Should I Take this Module
Kishori knows that the 15 to 20 devices in a patientâ€™s room wirelessly connect to the network. She also uses a wireless tablet. While working at the nurses' station, she noticed that the wireless network on her desktop computer was disabled. However, she still has access to patient records. How is the desktop connected?

How does communication transmit across a network? The answer is network media. Media provides a channel over which the message travels from source to destination. In modern networks, there are primarily three types of media used. Do you know what they are? Take this module to learn about media types.


6.0.2 What Will I Learn in this Module?
Module Title: Network Media

Module Objective: Describe common network media.


6.1.1 Video - Network Media Types
This is a media player component. Select the play / pause button to watch or listen.
Press the Play button to watch the video.


6.1.2 Three Media Types
Data is transmitted across a network on media. The media provides the channel over which the message travels from source to destination.

Modern networks primarily use three types of media to interconnect devices, as shown in the figure:

Metal wires within cables - Data is encoded into electrical impulses.
Glass or plastic fibers within cables (fiber-optic cable) - Data is encoded into pulses of light.
Wireless transmission - Data is encoded via modulation of specific frequencies of electromagnetic waves.

The four main criteria for choosing network media are these:

What is the maximum distance that the media can successfully carry a signal?
What is the environment in which the media will be installed?
What is the amount of data and at what speed must it be transmitted?
What is the cost of the media and installation?


6.1.3 Common Network Cables
List of expandable sections. Select each button to expand the content.
The three most common network cables are twisted-pair, coaxial cable, and fiber-optic cable.

Click below for more information about each cable type.
Twisted-Pair Cable

Ethernet technology generally uses twisted-pair cables to interconnect devices. Because Ethernet is the foundation for most local networks, twisted-pair is the most commonly encountered type of network cabling.

In twisted-pair, wires are grouped in pairs and twisted together to reduce interference. The pairs of wires are colored so that you can identify the same wire at each end. Typically, in each pair, one of the wires is a solid color and its partner is the same color striped onto a white background.


Coaxial Cable

Coaxial was one of the earliest types of network cabling developed. Coaxial cable is the kind of copper cable used by cable TV companies. It is also used for connecting the various components which make up satellite communication systems. Coaxial cable has a single rigid copper core that conducts the signal. This core is typically surrounded by a layer of insulation, braided metal shielding, and a protective jacket. It is used as a high-frequency transmission line to carry high-frequency or broadband signals.



Fiber-Optic Cable

Fiber-optic cable can be either glass or plastic with a diameter about the same as a human hair and it can carry digital information at very high speeds over long distances. Because light is used instead of electricity, electrical interference does not affect the signal. Fiber-optic cables have many uses as well as communications. They are also used in medical imaging, medical treatment, and mechanical engineering inspection.

They have a very high bandwidth, which enables them to carry very large amounts of data. Fiber is used in backbone networks, large enterprise environments, and large data centers. It is also used extensively by telephone companies.


6.1.4 Check Your Understanding - Network Media Types
Check your understanding of network media types by choosing the correct answer to the following questions.

6.2.2 Webster - Reflection Questions
I had no idea that a network needed to have different cables for different uses, did you? I thought all the cables were the same and that they all carried the same type of signal. And electrical interference? Now I get why my smartphone connection sometimes drops if I stand too close to my microwave! Do you know about all the cables that are used in your school or office network?
